Let's get started, shall we:
Calculation mode is 'fully_theoretical'.
Chosen facility is 'HYPULSE_rst_Mach_8_to_10_nozzle_area_ratio_175'.
Facility type is 'reflected_shock_tunnel'.
------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up facility driver condition.
Chosen driver condition is 'HYPULSE_RST_M8_driver_condition'.
Driver gas model is CEAGas.
Driver gas composition is {'Ar': 0.6, 'O2': 0.133, 'H2': 0.267} (by moles) (gam = 1.41, R = 289.07 J/kg K).
Driver rupture conditions are p4 = 37.31 MPa, T4 = 3861.00 K, M_throat = 0.00.
------------------------------------------------------------
The configuration in the driven tube is as follows:
test_gas_file_name =  None
shock_tube_fill_state_name =  s1
Test gas is n2-o2-with-ions. Test gas gas model is CEAGas.
Shock tube fill pressure (p1) is 911162.76 Pa.
Shock tube fill temperature (T1) is 298.15 K.
Nozzle area ratio is 175.0.
