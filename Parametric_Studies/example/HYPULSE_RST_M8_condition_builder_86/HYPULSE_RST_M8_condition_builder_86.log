Running PITOT3 version: 16-Dec-2023
------------------------------------------------------------
Let's get started, shall we:
Calculation mode is 'fully_theoretical'.
Chosen facility is 'HYPULSE_rst_Mach_8_to_10_nozzle_area_ratio_175'.
Facility type is 'reflected_shock_tunnel'.
------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up facility driver condition.
Chosen driver condition is 'HYPULSE_RST_M8_driver_condition'.
Driver gas model is CEAGas.
Driver gas composition is {'Ar': 0.6, 'O2': 0.133, 'H2': 0.267} (by moles) (gam = 1.41, R = 289.07 J/kg K).
Driver rupture conditions are p4 = 37.31 MPa, T4 = 3861.00 K, M_throat = 0.00.
------------------------------------------------------------
The configuration in the driven tube is as follows:
test_gas_file_name =  None
shock_tube_fill_state_name =  s1
Test gas is n2-o2-with-ions. Test gas gas model is CEAGas.
Shock tube fill pressure (p1) is 546227.72 Pa.
Shock tube fill temperature (T1) is 298.15 K.
Nozzle area ratio is 175.0.
The run appears to have failed. The error message is:
failed to compute normal shock jump.
The result will not be added to the output.
Cleaning the simulation folder of run files as this is normally done at the end of each simulation.
------------------------------------------------------------
Removing temporary files created during the running of the program.
------------------------------------------------------------
The dummy file HYPULSE_RST_M8_condition_builder_86_failed.txt will also be created in the folder so the program knows that the run failed.
