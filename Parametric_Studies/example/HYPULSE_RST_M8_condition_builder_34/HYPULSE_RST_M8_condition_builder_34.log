Starting steady expansion through the nozzle using an area ratio of 175.0
Due to the fact that this is a reflected shock simulation, we must first expand to the throat condition (state 6).
M6 expected is 1.0 and M6 found is 0.9944.
M6 is just below 1.0 so it is being set to 1.0 so the code can continue.
The velocity has also been slightly adjusted from 1150.4869 m/s to 1157.0009 m/s.

Nozzle expansion has failed.
We are below the set cutoff temperature of 5000.0 K so we are going to try performing the nozzle expansion without ions.

Cannot return the total enthalpy as PITOT3 failed to calculate it.
Will return None.
Total enthalpy could not be calculated, so the flight equivalent velocity could not be calculated either.
self.flight_equivalent_velocity will be set to None.
Cannot return the flight equivalent velocity as PITOT3 failed to calculate it.
Will return None.
